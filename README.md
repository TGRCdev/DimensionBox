# DimensionBox
This project demonstrates the use of an inner `Viewport` to seperate an outer hollow vehicle's `RigidBody` from colliding and interacting with inner `RigidBody`s. The box can be rotated and translated freely without affecting the inner capsule rigidbody. This can be used to instance the internal world of a large moving object, like a space ship or a submarine.
