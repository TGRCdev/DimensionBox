# DimensionBox
This project demonstrates the use of an inner `Viewport` to transform an outer hollow vehicle without affecting any physics objects inside of the vehicle, and to prevent inner physics bodies from affecting outer vehicle's physics. This can be used to instance the internal world of a large moving object, like a space ship or a submarine.
